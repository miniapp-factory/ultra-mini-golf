+Code the following app
+```
+Create a complete, ready-to-play 2D mini-golf platformer game for Farcaster (Warpcast frames) using HTML5 + JavaScript (Phaser 3 or PixiJS v7+ is preferred, but pure Canvas is acceptable if it keeps the total size small).
+
+Core requirements:
+
+1. Game type: 2D side view mini-golf (like classic mini-golf but with platformer physics: gravity, bounce, ramps, moving platforms, wind zones, etc.).
+2. Multiplayer: 1 human player vs 3 AI-controlled bots (4 players total). Show all 4 balls on screen at the same time with different colors (human = yellow, bot1 = red, bot2 = blue, bot3 = green).
+3. Course generation: Every game the entire course (hole) must be 100% procedurally generated and always solvable (the ball must have a physically possible path to the hole with ≤ 20 strokes max). 
+   - Screen size: 800 × 600 px (standard Frame size).
+   - Start tee on the left side, hole on the right side.
+   - Terrain: generate a smooth but wavy ground made of multiple quadratic/cubic Bézier segments or physics polygons.
+   - Obstacles (randomly choose 4–7 of the following, never blocking the hole):
+     - Static bumps and ramps
+     - Moving platforms (horizontal or vertical)
+     - Wind zones (left/right arrows that apply constant force)
+     - Bounce pads (high restitution)
+     - Water hazards (instant respawn at last safe position if touched)
+     - Teleporters (pair of portals)
+     - Spikes (same as water)
+     - Rotating windmills or gates
+   - Par is randomly between 3 and 6.
+   - The generator must run a quick physics simulation or A* pathfinding check at generation time to guarantee solvability before showing the level to the player.
+
+4. Controls (Farcaster Frame compatible):
+   - Tap/click and drag from the ball to set direction and power (classic golf swing meter style: line with arrow + power bar).
+   - Release to shoot.
+   - One single HTML file + inline JS/CSS (no external assets except Google fonts if needed). Total size < 300 KB so it loads instantly in Frames.
+
+5. Turn order:
+   - Players take turns in fixed order (human first, then bot1, bot2, bot3).
+   - After all 4 have holed out, show final leaderboard with strokes for this hole and “Next hole” button (new random course).
+
+6. AI bots:
+   - Simple but believable: pre-calculate a reasonable path using basic physics prediction (simulate 6–8 bounces ahead) and aim slightly off perfect trajectory (add 2–8% random error) so they sometimes miss but usually score close to par.
+
+7. Visual style:
+   - Bright, cartoonish mini-golf aesthetic.
+   - Grass texture background, simple shadows under balls.
+   - Hole is a classic black cup with flag.
+   - Particle effect + sound (use Web Audio beep or short base64 sound) on hole-in.
+
+8. Scoring & UI:
+   - Current player highlight.
+   - Stroke counter per player.
+   - Small leaderboard top-right.
+   - “Share on Warpcast” button when the hole ends.
+
+9. Technical constraints for Farcaster Frames:
+   - Must work as a single static HTML file hosted on a CDN.
+   - Use only inline data URIs for tiny sprites/sounds if needed.
+   - Must start instantly when the Frame is opened (no loading screen longer than 1 second).
+   - Include the necessary <meta> tags for Frame validation (og:title, og:image preview of a sample hole, fc:frame buttons: “Swing!” and later “Next hole”).

+Cancel and delete any previously created game. Start completely from scratch and create a brand new game with the following specifications:
+
+Game Title/Concept: "Color Rush" – A fast-paced "find and tap the matching colors" game.
+
+Gameplay:
+- Create a grid of 7 rows × 5 columns (35 clickable squares in total).
+- Each square must be filled with a random solid color.
+- Use only a set of 8-10 common, clearly distinguishable colors (e.g., red, blue, green, yellow, purple, orange, pink, brown, black, white, cyan, lime, etc.). Make sure the colors are very different from each other so they are easy to recognize.
+
+Layout (top to bottom):
+1. Top bar containing:
+   - A large example color swatch (the target color for the current round).
+   - Next to it, clearly display the name of the color (optional but recommended).
+   - A countdown timer (format: 10.0 seconds, with one decimal place).
+
+2. Below the top bar: the 7×5 grid of colored squares.
+
+Rules and mechanics:
+- At the start of each round, randomly choose one of the colors as the "target color" and show it in the top bar.
+- Randomly fill all 35 grid squares with colors (including several squares of the target color). There must always be at least 3–10 squares of the target color.
+- The timer starts at 10 seconds for the first round and counts down to 0.
+- The player must tap ONLY the squares that exactly match the target color shown at the top.
+- Tapping a wrong color does nothing negative (no penalty), but it wastes time.
+- As soon as the player has correctly tapped EVERY square that matches the target color, the round is instantly won:
+   - The timer immediately freezes/stops at the remaining time.
+   - A "Round Complete!" message appears briefly.
+   - The next round automatically starts after 1 second.
+- For each successfully completed round, the starting time for the next round decreases by 1 second (10 → 9 → 8 → 7 → ... down to a minimum of 2 or 1 second).
+- If the timer reaches 0 before the player finishes tapping all correct squares, the game ends and shows the final score (number of rounds completed).
+
+Additional requirements:
+- Make the game visually clean, colorful, and mobile-friendly (large tap targets).
+- Add a score counter: "Round X" or "Score: X rounds".
+- After game over, show the final score and a "Play Again" button.
+- Include satisfying sound effects (optional but preferred) for correct taps, round win, and game over.
